# forecast-tracker

A self-updating forecast scoreboard. Every day a GitHub Actions job pulls fresh public data (Houston weather and air quality, ERCOT electricity demand, a Buffalo Bayou river gauge), issues 1 to 7 day forecasts from a gradient-boosting model and two baselines, and scores earlier forecasts once the real values arrive. The results are published as a static page on GitHub Pages, with every forecast kept in the repository so anyone can audit it.

Live page: the URL appears here after the first deploy.

## How forecasts are kept honest

Forecast and outcome files are append-only: a published row is never edited or deleted, so a forecast cannot be quietly rewritten after the answer is known. CI runs `python -m ftracker.immutability` on every push and pull request and fails if any existing data row was changed or removed, and the daily workflow runs the same check before it pushes.

## Series

- `weather_tmax`: daily maximum temperature in Houston (Open-Meteo), degC
- `air_quality_aqi`: daily mean US AQI in Houston (Open-Meteo)
- `electricity_peak_mw`: daily peak ERCOT demand (EIA), MW
- `river_discharge_cfs`: Buffalo Bayou discharge at Houston (USGS 08074000), ft3/s

See `docs/metro.md` for why Houston.

## Run locally

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
python -m ftracker.cli daily    # needs EIA_API_KEY in the environment
python -m ftracker.cli site     # builds site/ and results/scoreboard.csv
python scripts/render_readme.py # refreshes the results block below
```
